# The "guitarompler"

A ["rompler"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rompler) designed to sound like an acoustic guitar, and to be embedded into
the range of guitar-themed instruments I've created.

## Try It!

A copy of the instrument is hosted [on my demo site](https://duhrer.github.io/demos/guitarompler/).

To use the latest version:

1. Check out the repository.
2. Install all dependencies using a command like `npm install`.
3. Host the `index.html`, `node_modules` and `src` directories from somewhere, for example by running
   `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` from the repository root.
